### **Step 1: Set Up Your AI Assistant**

First, you'll need to create and configure your AI assistant in the Growbro.ai dashboard. This initial setup is quick and intuitive.

1.  **Navigate to the Dashboard:** Log in to your Growbro.ai account and go to the main dashboard.
2.  **Create a New AI:** Click on "Create New AI" to start the setup process.
3.  **Provide Business Details:** Fill in your business name, industry, and a brief description. This context helps the AI understand your brand.
4.  **Define Your Audience and Use Case:** Specify your target audience and the primary goal of the chatbot (e.g., lead generation, customer support).
5.  **Set the Tone and Personality:** Choose a personality for your AI—from professional to friendly—to match your brand's voice.

> **Pro Tip:** The more detailed you are in this step, the better your AI will be at engaging with your visitors.

### **Step 2: Customize Your Chatbot's Appearance**

2.  **Update Branding:** Upload your logo and select your brand's primary colors.
3.  **Adjust the Widget:** Choose the chatbot widget's position on the screen (e.g., bottom-right) and customize the welcome message.
4.  **Personalize Forms:** Add or modify fields in the lead capture form to gather the information you need.

> **Best Practice:** Use a clear and inviting welcome message to encourage visitors to interact with the chatbot.

### **Step 3: Embed the Chatbot on Your Website**

With your chatbot configured and customized, it's time to add it to your website. Growbro.ai makes this incredibly simple with a single code snippet.

1.  **Get the Embed Code:** Go to the "Get AI Code & Test AI" section in your dashboard.
2.  **Copy the Snippet:** Copy the provided JavaScript code snippet.
3.  **Paste the Code:** Open your website's HTML and paste the snippet just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<!-- Add this script just before the closing </body> tag -->
<script src="https://cdn.growbro.ai/chatbot.js" id="growbro-chat" data-bot-id="YOUR_BOT_ID"></script>
```

For modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Next.js, we provide specific instructions to make integration even smoother. You can find these in our official documentation.
