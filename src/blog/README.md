# Blog Posts

Add new Markdown (.md) files in this folder to publish new blog posts. Each file should start with YAML frontmatter:

---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Your Name or Team"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
summary: "Short summary for previews."
---

Write your post content below the frontmatter.
